# Memory Optimization Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **DGX Station A100 Memory Crashes**: The original configuration tried to allocate 400GB for Gubbins on a 512GB system, leaving insufficient buffer for the OS and other processes.

2. **Missing Google Cloud VM Profile**: No optimized profile existed for large Google Cloud instances with 192 vCPUs and 1,536GB RAM.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed DGX A100 Profile (`conf/profiles/dgx_a100.config`)

**Memory Allocations (Before → After):**
- Gubbins: 400GB → 350GB (safer allocation)
- Max memory limit: 500GB → 480GB (leaves 32GB buffer)
- Process high memory: 400GB → 320GB

**Additional Improvements:**
- Extended time limits for memory-constrained processing
- Added retry strategy for memory-related failures
- Added specific configuration for `RECOMBINATION_GUBBINS` process

### 2. Enhanced Google VM Profile (`conf/profiles/google_vm_large.config`)

**Optimized for 192 vCPUs, 1,536GB RAM:**
- Gubbins: Up to 1200GB memory allocation
- Max memory limit: 1400GB (leaves buffer for system)
- High CPU utilization: Up to 128 CPUs for CPU-intensive processes
- Added specific configuration for `RECOMBINATION_GUBBINS` process

### 3. Added Google VM Profile to nextflow.config

- Integrated `google_vm_large` profile into main configuration
- Added Docker optimizations with increased shared memory (64GB)

### 4. Created Comprehensive Documentation

**New Documentation Files:**
- `docs/memory-optimization.md`: Detailed memory optimization guide
- `docs/profile-quick-reference.md`: Quick reference for all profiles
- `MEMORY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

**Updated Documentation:**
- `README.md`: Added Google VM profile information and improved troubleshooting

### 5. Created Helper Scripts

**New Scripts:**
- `bin/recommend_profile.sh`: Analyzes system and recommends appropriate profile
- Enhanced `bin/check_system_resources.sh`: Better system detection and recommendations

## Profile Comparison

| Profile | Target System | Memory Limit | Gubbins Memory | Max Genomes |
|---------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| `dgx_a100` | DGX Station A100 | 480GB | 350GB | ~500 |
| `google_vm_large` | Google Cloud Large VM | 1400GB | 1200GB | 1000+ |
| `large_dataset` | High-memory workstation | 1000GB | 600GB | ~400 |

## Usage Examples

### DGX Station A100 (Fixed)
```bash
# Now works reliably within 512GB constraint
nextflow run main.nf -profile dgx_a100 --input data/ --outdir results/
```

### Google Cloud Large VM (New)
```bash
# Optimized for ultra-large datasets
nextflow run main.nf -profile google_vm_large --input data/ --outdir results/
```

### System Detection (New)
```bash
# Get profile recommendation
./bin/recommend_profile.sh

# Check system resources
./bin/check_system_resources.sh
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Prevents Memory Crashes**: DGX A100 profile now leaves adequate memory buffer
2. **Maximizes Cloud Performance**: Google VM profile utilizes full capacity of large instances
3. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced retry strategies for memory-related failures
4. **User Guidance**: Comprehensive documentation and helper scripts
5. **Automatic Detection**: Scripts can detect system type and recommend profiles

## Troubleshooting

### If DGX A100 Still Crashes
```bash
# Further reduce memory allocation
nextflow run main.nf -profile dgx_a100 --max_memory 400.GB
```

### For Very Large Datasets (1000+ genomes)
```bash
# Use Google Cloud large instance
nextflow run main.nf -profile google_vm_large
```

### Monitor Memory Usage
```bash
# During execution
htop

# After execution
cat results/pipeline_info/execution_report_*.html
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Known Dataset**: Use a dataset that previously failed on DGX A100
2. **Monitor Resources**: Use `htop` to verify memory usage stays within limits
3. **Check Logs**: Review execution reports for resource utilization
4. **Validate Results**: Ensure output quality is maintained with new memory constraints

## Future Considerations

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Could implement genome count-based memory scaling
2. **Memory Profiling**: Add detailed memory usage tracking
3. **Cloud Cost Optimization**: Implement preemptible instance support
4. **Container Optimization**: Further optimize Docker/Singularity memory usage

These fixes should resolve the memory crashes on DGX Station A100 while providing excellent performance on Google Cloud large instances.
